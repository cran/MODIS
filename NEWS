MODIS 1.1.0

New features:

  * `getTile()` now supports interactive tile selection from the MODIS Sinusoidal grid powered by **mapedit** (https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit).
  * Creation of yearly composite layers has been made available through `temporalComposite()` and `aggInterval()`.
  * Meaning of 'quiet' argument in `MODISoptions()` has changed and now determines whether `getHdf()` (or `runGdal()`) print download information to the console. 

Bugfixes:

  * 'condition has length > 1' warning message from `transDate()` when specifying multiple 'begin' or 'end' dates.
  * 'no non-missing arguments to min (max); returning Inf' warning message from `getTile()` when 'x' was missing and 'tileH' or 'tileV' were specified as `numeric`. 
  * ''begin' and 'end' dates seem to be confused, reordering dates...' warning message from `aggInterval()` when actual end date (ie end of current fortnightly/monthly time interval) lies in the future.
  * 'length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent' error in `temporalComposite()` when only one layer is available for a particular aggregation period. 

Changes:

  * `transDate()` is now also compatible with true 'Date' objects.
  * Argument 'buffer' is no longer available for `getTile()`. As a result, **rgeos** could be removed from package imports. 
  * `getTile()` does no longer support MERIS and SRTM data. As regards the latter, `raster::getData(name = "SRTM", ...)` could be used instead. 
  * Further, `getTile()` is no longer compatible with 'list' input. In the course of this, argument 'extent' has been replaced by 'x' in order to avoid confusion with `raster::extent()`.
  * `temporalComposite()` now relies on `raster::calc()` instead of `raster::overlay()`, which allows the specification of 'na.rm' separate from 'fun'.
  * `aggInterval()` does no longer take 'numeric' input (ie years).
