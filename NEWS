MODIS 1.1.2

New features:

  * Added remaining products from the LP DAAC MODIS Products Table (<https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table>).
  * Explicit specification of 'pos1','pos2' arguments passed to extractDate() and orgTime() is no longer required when dealing with standard MODIS file names.

Bugfixes:

  * 'unable to find an inherited method for function 'extent' for signature '"MODISextent"'' from getHdf() when 'extent' was a Spatial* object.
  * 'Error in rgdal::rawTransform(projfrom, projto, nrow(xy), xy[, 1], xy[, : no arguments in initialization list' due to insufficient strsplit() on Windows
  * Orphaned hole and self-intersection errors from getTile() due to some non-valid geometries in map("worldHires", ...) (eg. "Philippines", "Spain").
  * 'DATE' subfolder was created in getOption("MODIS_localArcPath") when running MODIS:::genString() with no particular date specified.
  
Changes:

  * Disabled use of EPSV (see <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV.html>) when downloading structure from LP DAAC, LAADS. The latter didn't work anymore with EPSV enabled.
  * getProduct() and getCollection() are now compatible with more than one input 'product' provided using eg. c().
  * At the same time, pattern matching for a distinct set of products (see <https://github.com/MatMatt/MODIS/issues/22>) is switched off as long as a proper regular expression is omitted.
  * The MODIS package is now licensed under the MIT license (<https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/MIT>).
  

MODIS 1.1.0

New features:

  * getTile() now supports interactive tile selection from the MODIS Sinusoidal grid powered by mapedit (<https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit>).
  * Creation of yearly composite layers has been made available through temporalComposite() and aggInterval().
  * Meaning of 'quiet' argument in MODISoptions() has changed and now determines whether getHdf() (or runGdal()) print download information to the console. 

Bugfixes:

  * 'condition has length > 1' warning message from transDate() when specifying multiple 'begin' or 'end' dates.
  * 'no non-missing arguments to min (max); returning Inf' warning message from getTile() when 'x' was missing and 'tileH' or 'tileV' were specified as numeric. 
  * ''begin' and 'end' dates seem to be confused, reordering dates...' warning message from aggInterval() when actual end date (ie end of current fortnightly/monthly time interval) lies in the future.
  * 'length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent' error in temporalComposite() when only one layer is available for a particular aggregation period. 

Changes:

  * transDate() is now also compatible with true 'Date' objects.
  * Argument 'buffer' is no longer available for getTile(). As a result, rgeos could be removed from package imports. 
  * getTile() does no longer support MERIS and SRTM data. As regards the latter, raster::getData(name = "SRTM", ...) could be used instead. 
  * Further, getTile() is no longer compatible with 'list' input. In the course of this, argument 'extent' has been replaced by 'x' in order to avoid confusion with raster::extent().
  * temporalComposite() now relies on raster::calc() instead of raster::overlay(), which allows the specification of 'na.rm' separate from 'fun'.
  * aggInterval() does no longer take 'numeric' input (ie years).


MODIS 1.0.0

* Initial release
